Explain what the "upstream" remote is usually used for, in your own words.
upstream remote
The source file from which users draw information. Given the term, the analogy of a water source and its distributaries is very fitting:-
Many people receive the same water (information) that comes downstream via distributaries.
However, if someone goes upstream to the source and makes a change, let's say adds red dye, then such change will affect all people receiving the information coming downstream.
It is used if it is necessary to make changes to the source that everyone draws from.
