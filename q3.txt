Explain what a branch is, in your own words.
branch
Creates a separate version of the code to which changes can be made.
Eventually, if changes between the two (or more) versions of code need to be consolidated, the merge or rebase function can be used.
Merging is best suited when dealing with remote repositories and multiple users so that the separate branches worked on by various people can remain distinctive.
Rebasing is best suited to local repositories with a single user.
